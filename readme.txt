Yahoo News Feed allows the news from your site to appear automatically in Yahoo News.

== Description ==
Yahoo News Feed allows the news from your site to appear automatically in Yahoo Search Results as news items.

From Yahoo: Display news information directly in Yahoo! Search. Add code to indicate to Yahoo! that a news story on your page, and when we next crawl your site, we'll take care of the rest. From your markup, we’ll be able to extract structured data from your site and render it automatically in an enhanced result in search results.
* Types of content permitted: news articles and opinion pieces with optional images.
* How soon after I add my markup will I see my enhanced result appear? Assuming your markup is correct, your enhanced result will appear after Yahoo! recrawls your page; this can take between a few days and a few weeks depending on your site.

Generated news feed is in NewsML1.2 format, as specified on [Yahoo! Search Monkey develop page](http://developer.search.yahoo.com/help/objects/news)
